	If I were to reflect on this whole semester so far I would start off with the thing I learned while doing this project is how a real world job would be like and understanding the tech structure to learn how to get the most cost efficient way to run websites as well as learning about how to secure websites safely. I would say that one of the biggest challenges was the fact that half of the team wasn't really working on the project so we were down two in front end and down one in the backend. A way we solved that was to have backend help out front end and work kind of like a full stack dev. And learning how to adapt with people who aren't pulling their weight. But for my future job I did like to learn how to secure websites and data and implementing middle ware as more security and session management. I have learned while trying to manage the project I learned that you should expect for the plan to go wrong and create a shell of the project first. Being very direct about the communication is also a key because from what I noticed is that once they stop talking to you they usually don't work on the project. I also would do more coding in person bc it helps understand and talk through what would be needed for the project and keep people in the same mind set and in line with the project.
